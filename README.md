# SQL_WorkBook

SQL database or relational database is a collection of highly structured tables, wherein each row reflects a data entity, and every column defines a specific information field. Relational databases are built using the structured query language (SQL) to create, store, update, and retrieve data. Therefore, SQL is the underlying programming language for all relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL, Oracle, and Sybase, among others.

**These SQL commands are mainly categorized into five categories:**

**DDL** – Data Definition Language.
**DQL** – Data Query Language.
**DML** – Data Manipulation Language.
**DCL** – Data Control Language.
**TCL** – Transaction Control Language.
