SQL database or relational database is a collection of highly structured tables, wherein each row reflects a data entity, and every column defines a specific information field. Relational databases are built using the structured query language (SQL) to create, store, update, and retrieve data. Therefore, SQL is the underlying programming language for all relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL, Oracle, and Sybase, among others.
